# Advent of Code 2018

So, this year I decided to participate in https://adventofcode.com/. 
Because I was looking to learn some backend language, I decided for Ruby (I really like functional languages ðŸ’Ž).
This repo has MY solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 challenge.

Remember, I'm looking to learn a new language, so you won't find any good practices, tests, or even good performance (maybe later I'll revisit this points).
If you're looking for a Ruby solution of AoC18, here you go!
The repo is divided in folders (days) with one to two .rb files with the solutions.
