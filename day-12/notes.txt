After some experiments found that on generation 161 the pots start a fixed pattern:
###.#....###...###....###......###....###....###....###....###.......###....###......###...###........###......###...........###......###....###...###...###.......###...###...###...###
From that point on, the next generations just move all planted pots one pot to the right.

I just need to find the planted positions on generation 161 and then sum them (50000000000-161)
